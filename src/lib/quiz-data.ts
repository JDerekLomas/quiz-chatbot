    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "Effective prompts are specific: describe what you want built, what technology to use, any constraints or requirements, and ideally show examples of desired behavior. Context helps Claude make better decisions about architecture and implementation.",

    explanation:
      "Give Claude more context when starting something new, working with complex existing code, or when the AI's output isn't matching your expectations. Share relevant files, explain your architecture, and describe the broader goal. More context = better results.",

      "Switch to a different AI model and hope for better results",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "The most effective debugging approach is to share the exact error message, describe what the code should do vs. what it actually does, and let Claude analyze the problem. Copy-paste the error \u2014 don't paraphrase it. Claude can often spot the issue immediately with good error context.",

    question:
      "Why is it important to review AI-generated code before shipping?",
    options: [
      "It's not important \u2014 AI code is always correct",
      "To catch bugs, security issues, and logic errors that the AI might have introduced",

      "To convert it from AI syntax to normal syntax",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "AI-generated code can contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or subtle logic errors. Always review what the AI produces: does it handle edge cases? Are there hardcoded values that should be configurable? Could user input cause problems? You're the quality gate.",

      "What's a good strategy for building something complex with AI?",

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "Complex projects work best when broken into small, testable pieces. Build the foundation first, verify it works, then add features one at a time. This 'incremental' approach catches problems early and keeps each AI interaction focused and manageable.",

    id: "claude-8",
    topic: "Working with Claude",
    question: "What's the purpose of the /compact command in Claude Code?",
    options: [
      "It compresses your project files to save disk space",
      "It summarizes the conversation to free up context window space",
      "It minifies your JavaScript code for production",
      "It removes all comments from your codebase",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "The /compact command summarizes your conversation history so Claude can keep working within its context window limit. Use it when you've been working for a while and Claude starts losing track of earlier context. It preserves the key decisions and current state.",

      "How should you handle it when Claude says it can't do something?",

      "Add 'please try harder' to your prompt",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "When Claude says it can't do something, try rephrasing your request, providing more context, or breaking the task into smaller steps. Sometimes the issue is ambiguity in your prompt, not a fundamental limitation. A different angle often works.",
  },

    topic: "Working with Claude",
    question: "What's the role of CLAUDE.md in a vibecoding workflow?",
    options: [
      "It's optional documentation for other developers",
      "It configures Claude's behavior for your specific project \u2014 like persistent instructions",
      "It's a required file for Claude Code to start up",
      "It stores your API key for authenticating with Claude",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "CLAUDE.md acts as persistent instructions for Claude in your project. Put your coding style preferences, project structure notes, deployment commands, and workflow rules there. Claude reads it at the start of every session, so you don't have to repeat yourself.",
